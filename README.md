# TO-DO List Web Application (Project 2)

This is a simple TO-DO List web application that allows users to add, check off, and remove tasks. The tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is reloaded.

- **Add Tasks:** Enter a task in the input box and click the "Add" button to add it to your TO-DO list.
- **Check Off Tasks:** Click on a task to mark it as completed. The text will be struck through to indicate it's done.
- **Remove Tasks:** Click the "remove" button next to a task to delete it from the list.
- **Persistent Data:** Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage and will persist even if the page is reloaded.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling the webpage, including the layout, colors, and responsiveness.

- **LocalStorage**: To save the tasks so they persist across sessions.
